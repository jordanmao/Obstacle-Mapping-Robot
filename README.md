# Obstacle-Mapping-Robot
A robot able to navigate its surroundings with human control input, detect obstaces with an ultrasonic sensor, and map obstacles and robot pathing on a 2D plane.

The robot was built using VEX V5 EDR parts. An ultrasonic sensor is mounted in front to detect the distance from an object in front. Two optical shaft encoders are attached to the left and right wheels to track revolutions for odometry. The ultrasonic sensor data is combined with the odometry data to map out the obstacles and robot pathing on a 2D plane.
